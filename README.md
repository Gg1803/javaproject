# Itertools Java Project

This project provides a set of custom iterator implementations inspired by Python's `itertools` module. The code is written in Java and demonstrates both forward and bidirectional iteration using custom classes. It also includes unit testing.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📦 Features

- **CountingIterator**:
  - Iterates from a given start to an end (exclusive).
  - Implements `hasNext()` and `next()`.

- **CountingDoubleEndedIterator**:
  - Supports both `next()` and `previous()` operations.
  - Allows navigation in both directions between a range of numbers.

- **ItertoolsTest**:
  - Unit tests for both iterator classes using basic assertions.
